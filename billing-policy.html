        <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold text-center mb-6">Billing Policy</h1>
        <p class="mb-4 text-xl">This Billing Policy is an integral part of the Leadbird ("ElevasionX") Terms of Service (https://elevasionx.com/terms/) and governs the billing terms and conditions for your use of ElevasionXâ€™s services (the "Services"). In case of any conflict between the Terms of Service and this Billing Policy, the Terms of Service shall prevail.</p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">General</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-xl">Upon signing, dating, and returning your Statement of Work (SOW), the Services will commence, and all corresponding payments as outlined in the SOW will become due and payable. Payments are to be made every 30 days throughout the duration of the "term" period. All prices are in USD, and payments are considered non-refundable as specified in the deliverables section of the SOW.</p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Payment Methods</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-xl">All payments must be made using a valid credit or debit card issued by American Express, MasterCard, Discover, or Visa, which must be kept on file with your Account ("Payment Methods"). Cheque transfers are not accepted. Each client will be charged a monthly technology fee, along with charges for all leads generated during that month, on the last day of every month. In the event that a charge fails, the client will have a 15-day grace period to resolve the issue. Failure to resolve the issue may result in account closure. Leadbird reserves the right to bill the card on file in advance.</p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-xl">Clients wishing to cancel their services must communicate with their designated Customer Success Manager via phone or email. This policy operates on a month-to-month basis, meaning cancellation does not absolve the client of any outstanding fees or payments owed. Any leads submitted for the current billing cycle will be invoiced to conclude the contract.</p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Account Pause</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-xl">Clients may choose to pause their account for a fee of $300 per month to maintain account status.</p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Billing Disputes</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-xl">To dispute any charge related to the Services, you must notify Leadbird in writing at accounts@elevasionx.com or through your designated Customer Success Manager within 30 days of the disputed charge. You agree not to dispute charges with your credit card company or bank for 30 days after notifying ElevasionX to allow for resolution. ElevasionX reserves the right to collect on services rendered and any associated payments in the event of a chargeback initiated before ElevasionX has had 30 days to resolve the issue.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-xl">In case of a chargeback from your credit card company or bank, ElevasionX will suspend the Account pending resolution. Regardless of the chargeback outcome, ElevasionX retains the right to collect on outstanding payments and may involve a third-party collection service or legal action for collection.</p>
